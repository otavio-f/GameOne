# GAME WITHOUT A NAME, BUT IS FIGHTING I GUESS

## How it works

In this game, two combatants attack each other until one (or both) lose. 

The game has two roles: an __offensive__ and a __defensive__. The character on the offensive uses it's __hability__ to damage the character on the defensive position. Only one is allowed to stay on the offensive, and the other has to stay on the defensive position. The character on the defensive position can switch if it is able to.
